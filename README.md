# main.py
Here I have put code that allows integration of fastAPI with a sample postgreSQL database called dvdrental.
In the code I use API GET requests to access data in different tables and columns in the database

# tonydb.py
Here I have general code that allows the user to perform CRUD operations on the database tonydb. Note that the PostgreSQL username is "postgres" and passoword is "postgres".
I have used GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH requests.
