# main.py
Here I have put code that allows integration of fastAPI with a sample relational (PostgreSQL) database called dvdrental.
In the code, I use GET requests with fastAPI to access data in different tables and columns in the database

# tonydb.py
Here I have general code that allows the user to perform CRUD operations on the database tonydb. Note that the PostgreSQL username is "postgres" and password is "postgres".
I have used GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH methods.
